Cloud Native Job Jar Cloud Custodian Task, Initial Proof of Concept created on 10-30-2023.

Three Cloud Custodian Policy files are provided that can be ran from the command line against cloud resources to identify their compliance with organizational policy, and actions can be taken in case those resources are not compliant.

Filters are used to narrow down the resources based on certain criteria, and actions are used to do something about the resources that met the criteria in the filters.
